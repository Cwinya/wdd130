        <p>My name is Cwinya Moses, and I am a student in the WDD 130 course. I love web development and creating interactive websites. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. I also have a keen interest in photography and enjoy capturing the beauty of nature. However, I am still learning and growing in this field. My level of expertise is still developing, and I am excited to continue my journey in web development. I will continue to build my skills and knowledge in this area. With time, I hope to become a proficient web developer. I'm moving forward with determination and enthusiasm. All because of my passion for technology and design. I'm working on improving my skills every day.</p>
